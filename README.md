# Node.js Event Loop Presentation

This repo contains slides and demo examples for my talk "Understanding the Node.js Event Loop" that I presented at the Node.js Global Summit 2022.

## Using This Repo

The `demos` directory contains several files. Each file is an independent demo that you can run with Node.js. For example:

```
node demos/01-synchronous.js
```

Try to guess the order in which the functions will be executed before running each example.
